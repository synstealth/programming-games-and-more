WeChall.net
For the people not familiar with challenge sites, a challenge site is mainly a site focussed on offering computer-related problems. 

Users can register at such a site and start solving challenges. There exist lots of different challenge types. The most common ones are the following: Cryptographic, Crackit, Steganography, Programming, Logic and Math/Science. The difficulty of these challenges vary as well.

It allows the users to get a complete overview of a users challenge history on every site he signed up for. Now how does this work exactly?
A user on this site can indicate which challenge sites he plays at with a specific username. Challenge sites can be selected from a simple drop-down list. His profile page will then contain an entry for this specific challenge site with the given username, along with some text describing how high he is ranked at that site. This will give a complete overview of one user in an instance.

This is pretty much a coder's playground!
